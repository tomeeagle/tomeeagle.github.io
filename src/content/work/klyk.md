## Custom section builds

> Including carousels, infographics and more.

Working on a freelance basis for a web development agency client, I took on the rebrand of the merchant's Shopify store. The clean and vibrant design was a pleasure to work on, and the finished site is a joy to use, with a visually appeling UI and great UX.

#### Project details

- Customising the Impact theme to match Figma design
- Modifying and creating new theme sections to meet the brief
- Custom JavaScript
