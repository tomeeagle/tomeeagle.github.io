## Gingerlily Shopify Store Build

I partnered with an agency to launch Gingerlily's new Shopify store, showcasing their luxurious silk bedding and homewares.  Established in 2004, Gingerlily uses premium mulberry silk to create exquisite, hypoallergenic bed linen, cushions, throws, and nightwear, from simple solids to elaborate prints.  Silk-filled pillows offer ultimate comfort. Gingerlily: luxurious silk delights.
